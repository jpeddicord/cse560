Warning! Dragons ahead.
-----------------------

This was a project developed for CSE 560 at The Ohio State University.
It is being published not necessairily to be used or developed, but in
the hopes that someone will find it useful, student or otherwise.

We're boldly publishing our revision history as well. Don't judge.

Also, while we're publishing this code for anyone to use/criticize/
learn from, using any portion of this code in your own class project
may be a violation of your college/university's academic policies.
Please consult your instructor/professor/supervisor/whatever to find
out whether this breakes any such policy. (in short: don't cheat.)
