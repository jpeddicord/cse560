============
Testing Plan
============

Our testing plan for the assembler will comprise of two parts: unit testing of individual components, and testing of the overall functionality and correctness of the whole program.

Overall Program Testing
=======================

Tests of the program functionality will be conducted by giving the program various test applicaitons to compile. The output of each run will be manually reviewed by the team, and will determine if further work is needed.

This is highly dependent on `Unit Testing`, as the correctness of individual parts effects the outcome of the overall program execution.

Unit Testing
============

Unit testing will use the NUnit testing framework. Each component will have several tests associated to throughly test the functionality and correctnes of the result.
