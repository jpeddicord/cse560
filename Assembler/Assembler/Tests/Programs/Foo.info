Short program testing some more syntax found in FFA including a few CNTL commands. Two lines in specific that are being tested by this program are line 5 (when the line is just a commment) and line 6 (when the line only contains whitespace).  Neither of these should throw errors but require a little special attention by the Assembler, so we want to ensure they work properly.
