Fourth program given to us to test during real time grading of SP1. This program gives some good tests for CNTL and JUMP, however it should give errors for the second half of the SOPER commands as these are being given labels and a SOPER instruction can only use numbers from 0 to 255 in the operand. Line 6 should also have an error as it is trying to find a symbol that does not exist in the program, and line 12 should give an error as the label given (x1) is not the same as X1.

Produces Expected Results: Yes
