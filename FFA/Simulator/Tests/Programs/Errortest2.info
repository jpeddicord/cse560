Another program testing error catching of the simulator. This tests mostly improper formatting of the load file. The errors that should be displayed are: ES.01, ES.02, ES.03, ES.05, ES.06, ES.07, ES.08, ES.09, ES.14, ES.18, ES.19, ES.20, ES.21, ES.23, ES.24 and ES.25. Descriptions of these errors can be found on the `errors page <errors.html>`_. This program tests error catching for READN and READC so it uses the following input (separated by commas here): [nothing], 5000000, abc, abcd, [nothing].
